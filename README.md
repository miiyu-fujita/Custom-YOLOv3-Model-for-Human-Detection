# mais202-final-project
Winter 2021 - McGill AI Society (MAIS202) Final Project 

To test the model on your own images:
1. open the following colab file: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ICeRi3TlQ6lSkv6Qynl3JVO7PLj02j38?usp=sharing
2. Before proceeding, make sure to set up your google drive properly, following the instructions in the first text box in the colab file. 
3. Carefully follow the instructions in the colab file and run cells accordingly.
4. Before proceeding to test the model on your own images, ensure that you have a folder called "images" in your "custom_yolov3" folder in your drive. 
> This "images" folder should contain all the images you wish to test the model on, and they should be named in the following manner: your_image_name.jpg (ex: books.jpg)
5. You are now ready to run and test the custom yolov3 model to detect human subjects! Remember to change the path to your image file before running the model so that the model can find the test image properly. 

Repository Information:
1. Custom_YOLOv3 contains the python script I have used to train my Custom YOLOv3 model. This code is heavily based on theAIGuys tutorial, which I have included as a reference in the project's presentation poster
2. Deliverables contains the deliverables I completed as I worked on my project.
